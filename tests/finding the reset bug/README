in this one i'm looking after a bug where ...
after running a test until the simulation explodes,
all subsequent runs will immediately explode.

and it's 100% reproducible on different platforms.
but it is 0% reproducible when running it without the GUI enabled ...
and 0% reproducible when running with GUI, but the solver isn't inserted to self.solvers
 (so the GUI isn't displaying the solver)
